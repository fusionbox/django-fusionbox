Behaviors
=========

Usage Notes
-----------

Because behaviors are ultimately implemented using a special metaclass, any model inheritance involving behaviors must come before any other parent class which inherits from Django's built in metaclass.

Example Correct and Incorrect Usage::

    class MyBaseModel(models.Model):
        pass

    # Incorrect Usage
    class MyChildModel(MyBaseModel, Timestampable):
        pass

    # Correct Usage
    class MyChildModel(Timestampable, MyBaseModel):
        pass
